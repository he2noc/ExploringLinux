# ExploringLinux
Learn some linux solutions and explain it to non-linux users

Motivation:
Recently, I could finally migrate to Linux in my home computer. However, it hasn't been a smooth transition. 
When I started to peek and tweak mpv and vim configuration files I started to feel many gaps. 
Between linux and non-linux users; programmers and non-programmers; and even betweeen old-time and new users of that specific software/tool/feature. 
I felt that some tutorials and forums talks are very hard to understand due to this difference. 
For that reason, I had the idea to start this project. 
Along with my learning curve, I will document and try to explain the process considering people who might not be faimliar with the basic of basics. 
I really like the idea behind Linux and would like to see gaining more adepts. 
Distros like Ubunutu and Mint became popular and I dare to say that they are friendly enough for anyone to start the Linux experience. 
However, I think of the people around me (family and friends) and I can't see them working around and troubleshooting things if they go one step away from vanilla. 
So I would like to start filling the gaps, making the transition less difficult. 
This way, I also feel that all my effort in learning this things would not go in vain and would serve for someone else.
