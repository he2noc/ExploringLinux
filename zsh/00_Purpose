# File: 00_Purpose
# Objective: To document the initial motivation for installing zsh and what it is expected to achieve

Motivation:
I started spend more time in the command line (for many different reasons). 
I would like it to me more friendly to work with. 
You can open, visualize and edit a file in the command line with some programs (vi, nano, etc). @more.examples
As I work with programming, I miss some of the highlight features (using different color to mark specific text). 
It would help a lot to have this feature.

Many times I also have to move around between directories (folders). 
The usual way is by the command "cd dir_name" (to enter the specific directory) and "cd .." (to go back to an upper directory). 
Moving back and forth becomes tedious (specially if you have not-so-good directory names). 
So an easier navigation style would be very welcomed. 

In my opinion, customizing one of your tools is one of most fun things you can do in Linux. 
As I started working more with the command line, I would like to make it a unique and personal experience. 

While looking for a solution, I found zsh and decide to give it a try. 
From the start, all information indicates that it is not just "install and go".
