https://ohmyz.sh/#install

Started going to the official page. There, at the bottom, I found 
"
Install oh-my-zsh now
Oh My Zsh is installed by running one of the following commands in your terminal. 
You can install this via the command-line with either curl or wget.
"

The first problem: what is "curl" or "wget".
As a Ubuntu user, I only knew the command "apt" for installation. 
So I did a little search. The result is at the end of this file

Before running things I didn't know exactly what would do, I went back to the main page.
Right under the installation block it is written:
"
Not ready to jump right in? We’re not offended; it’s never a bad idea to read the documentation first.
"
Clicking on the word "documentation" lead me to another page
(https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki)

Here there seemed to have many information that I would like to check after installing zsh. 
So, for the moment I bookmarked the page and focused on its first 2 lines:
"
Welcome to the Oh My Zsh wiki
  If you don't have zsh installed, see Installing Zsh.
"
Clicking on the word "Installing ZSH" would take me to another page 
(https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Installing-ZSH)

Here I found easy to understand installation steps. 
There are instructions for installation on different platforms (Ubuntu among them)
I read and followed all the instructions. 
However, it didn't work out in the first try. 
There was no error. But loggin out and going back in didn't make the change.

Between the steps 3 and 4 there is an observation:
"
Note that this will not work if Zsh is not in your authorized shells list (/etc/shells) or 
if you don't have permission to use chsh. If that's the case you'll need to use a different procedure.
"
Clicking in "you'll need to use a different procedure" lead me to a google search result page. 
The first result was
(https://askubuntu.com/questions/131823/how-to-make-zsh-the-default-shell)

Here I might open a parenthesis.
When things don't work the way they were expecte to be, there could be many possible causes. 
This is called Troubleshooting. 
We could compare this with like going to the doctor. 
Just by saying "I feel bad" will not allow the doctor to judge what you have and what we can do to solve that. 
The patient (in this case, you) have to note and say in details what symptoms he/she is having. 
Searching the answer in the internet is the same. 
There will be many different answers and possible solutions. 
But you have to filter which solution would apply to your specific case. 
Unfortunately, this is something only you can do (it's your computer). 
But not necessarily, you have to do it alone (that's why the forum is open to queestions. 
There are people in the community really willing to help)

Going back to the result of the search. 
They suggest you to check some things and even offer work around (some of them a little not recommended, but that works)
Using the command
grep zsh /etc/shells
The result I got was
/bin/bash/
/usr/bin/zsh
This is the list of shells that my system recognizes and its location. 
So I have the "bash" (which is the default on Ubuntu) and I have zsh (which is at the location /usr/bin/)
One of the suggestions said to specically use the location of zsh.
So instead of using the command written on the wiki page
chsh -s $(which zsh)
I used 
chsh -s /usr/bin/zsh

That solved the problem. When I logged in again, the zsh shell was loaded. 
This will be treated on the next section


////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Basic settings
When first prompted the shell presents a configuration step. 
If you don't know what you're doing, just go with the default one (you can edit it later).
If you want or are curious about, navigate through the menu and select the initial settings.

And that's it... Right? 
Probably not. 
Successfully instaled the zsh shell but, out of the box, it doesn't comes with the features I wanted to. 
So now we have to go to the next phase: the customization.

CURL
It's an abbreviation of "Client URL". 
With this command you can access the content of a web page (see its HTML, download files, among others)
