## The installation process

First things first. I got interested in the oh-my-zsh framework. Which works in the zsh shell. 
That means we have 2 different things. 
Meaning that we ultimately have 2 different installations to do. Just keeo this in mind.

Official Page
https://ohmyz.sh/

Started going to the official page. There, at the bottom, I found 
"
Install oh-my-zsh now
Oh My Zsh is installed by running one of the following commands in your terminal. 
You can install this via the command-line with either curl or wget.
"

The first problem: what is "curl" or "wget".
As a Ubuntu user, I only knew the command "apt" for installation. 
So I did a little search. The result is at the end of this file

Before running things I didn't know exactly what would do, I went back to the main page.
Right under the installation block it is written:
"
Not ready to jump right in? We’re not offended; it’s never a bad idea to read the documentation first.
"
Clicking on the word "documentation" lead me to another page
(https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki)

Here there seemed to have many information that I would like to check after installing zsh. 
So, for the moment I bookmarked the page and focused on its first 2 lines:
"
Welcome to the Oh My Zsh wiki
  If you don't have zsh installed, see Installing Zsh.
"
Clicking on the word "Installing ZSH" would take me to another page 
(https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Installing-ZSH)

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ZSH installation
Remembering that ZSH is the shell. This is a pre-requesite step before installing oh-my-zhs.

Here I found easy to understand installation steps. 
There are instructions for installation on different platforms (Ubuntu among them)
I read and followed all the instructions. 
However, it didn't work out in the first try. 
There was no error. But loggin out and going back in didn't make the change.

Between the steps 3 and 4 there is an observation:
"
Note that this will not work if Zsh is not in your authorized shells list (/etc/shells) or 
if you don't have permission to use chsh. If that's the case you'll need to use a different procedure.
"
Clicking in "you'll need to use a different procedure" lead me to a google search result page. 
The first result was
(https://askubuntu.com/questions/131823/how-to-make-zsh-the-default-shell)

Here I might open a parenthesis.
When things don't work the way they were expecte to be, there could be many possible causes. 
This is called Troubleshooting. 
We could compare this with like going to the doctor. 
Just by saying "I feel bad" will not allow the doctor to judge what you have and what we can do to solve that. 
The patient (in this case, you) have to note and say in details what symptoms he/she is having. 
Searching the answer in the internet is the same. 
There will be many different answers and possible solutions. 
But you have to filter which solution would apply to your specific case. 
Unfortunately, this is something only you can do (it's your computer). 
But not necessarily, you have to do it alone (that's why the forum is open to queestions. 
There are people in the community really willing to help)

Going back to the result of the search. 
They suggest you to check some things and even offer work around (some of them a little not recommended, but that works)
Using the command
grep zsh /etc/shells
The result I got was
/bin/bash/
/usr/bin/zsh
This is the list of shells that my system recognizes and its location. 
So I have the "bash" (which is the default on Ubuntu) and I have zsh (which is at the location /usr/bin/)
One of the suggestions said to specically use the location of zsh.
So instead of using the command written on the wiki page
chsh -s $(which zsh)
I used 
chsh -s /usr/bin/zsh

That solved the problem. When I logged in again, the zsh shell was loaded. 

When first prompted the shell presents a configuration step. 
If you don't know what you're doing, just go with the default one (you can edit it later).
If you want or are curious about, navigate through the menu and select the initial settings.
Now that the shell is running, we can go on and install the oh-my-zhs framwork

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Installing oh-my-zsh
Now we go back to the install page of oh-my-zhs (https://ohmyz.sh/#install)

You can copy and paste the command line that is written on the site and hit enter to start the installation.
During the process, it was prompted to me wether I wanted to change the default shell to zsh
Just answered yes and the shell already loaded with the new look


////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Configuring oh-my-zsh
Out of the box, oh-my-zsh doesn't activate many features, including some basic bash features. 
I think you don't have to worry which these features are. 
If you use one of them, you will immediately notice and you can configure it then. 

oh-my-zsh allows for Plugins and Themes. 
Unfortunatelly, there are several of them and would be practically impossible to explain how to go through everyone.
So I'll have to excuse myself and ask to everyone to search for and follow the specific instructions
for the installations of your plugins/themes of interested. 
For further instructions, you can check the official wiki page (https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki)

To tell the truth, I don't like to end this explication like this. 
It feels like giving up so close to the end line. 
But that's the limnit I found on this step-by-step.
Any further comments would be to specific for a Theme/Plugin and might not apply for others.
So it is best to go direct to your interest source and continue from there.

CURL
It's an abbreviation of "Client URL". 
"curl is a tool to transfer data from or to a server, using one of the supported protocols"
(retrieved from https://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html)

WGET
Is also a command to download files from a server over a network.
"wget has been designed for robustness over slow or unstable network connections; 
if a download fails due to a network problem, it will keep retrying until the whole file has been retrieved"
(retrieved from https://www.computerhope.com/unix/wget.htm)
